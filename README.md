Hi, my name is **Joonwon (Eric)** Lee. Welcome to my github. 

I am currently an undergrad at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics & Data Science. I have a broad interest in computers, with a particular focus on systems software and cryptography (specifically blockchain). You can also check out what I have learned at UCLA in my personal website.

This summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at Samsung Electronics under Samsung Research, contributing to the Tizen OS platform team. Previously, I worked as a Frontend/Mobile developer at LG. 

At UCLA, I work with Prof. Rafail Ostrovsky and Prof. Sam Kumar on a multi party computation project. (Expected to submit IEEE S&P Nov 2024)
